# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation 

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates **Customer Segmentation** using **unsupervised learning techniques**.  
Customer segmentation is a key step in understanding user behavior and building **targeted business strategies**.  

By analyzing customer demographics and purchase behavior, we group similar customers into clusters using **machine learning algorithms**.  
This helps businesses to:  
- 🎯 Run targeted marketing campaigns  
- 🛒 Recommend personalized products  
- 💰 Improve sales and retention
